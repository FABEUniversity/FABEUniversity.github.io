              </span>
              <p>
                Leo joins a seminar on ethics in AI, a critical component of their education at FABE. The seminar,
              accessible via FOLT, features speakers from diverse fields, including philosophy, computer
              science, and law. Discussions revolve around the ethical implications of AI in society,
              encouraging students to think critically about their future roles as innovators.

                7:00 PM - Team Collaboration on MOOC
              </span>
              <p>
                Leo collaborates with his project team via a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) platform.
                Using tools like Teams, Miro, and Slack, they discuss their ongoing project: developing a
                sustainable urban infrastructure model. Each team member, including international peers,
                shares updates and insights, facilitated by the seamless integration of these tools into FOLT.

                8:00 PM - Personalized Help and Study Review
              </span>
              <p>
                As the day winds down the AI tutor helps Leo create his study plan. For his modules, the AI creates schedules for when he should study, when assignments are due, and what else is coming up in his studies. Next semester, for example, Leo has an internship. The tutor suggests companies that might fit his study profile and helps him write an application letter.
